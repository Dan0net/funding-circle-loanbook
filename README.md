# Funding Circle Loanbook Analysis

[This ipython notebook](https://github.com/Dan0net/funding-circle-loanbook/blob/master/LoanBook%20Analysis.ipynb) predicts the outcome of loans on Funding Circle's live Loan Requests page.

It uses an AdaBoost ensemble regressor to make estimations based on the information available on the Loan Requests page.

Feel free to suggest improvements and create pull requests.

Run the code through to the end to get results for https://www.fundingcircle.com/lend/loan-requests/.
